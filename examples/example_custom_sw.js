/**
 * Example: adding Countly web push to a service worker you already have.
 *
 * By default the SDK registers countly_sw.js under its own scope, countly-push/ next to the file. Do
 * this only to run a single worker, and only if no other push provider subscribes through yours.
 *
 * On the page, hand the SDK your registration so it does not try to register countly_sw.js:
 *
 *   navigator.serviceWorker.register("/sw.js").then(function (registration) {
 *       Countly.init({
 *           app_key: "YOUR_APP_KEY",
 *           url: "https://your.server.ly",
 *           push_vapid_public_key: "YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY",
 *           push_service_worker_registration: registration
 *       });
 *   });
 *
 * and call Countly.enable_push_notifications() from a click handler, as usual.
